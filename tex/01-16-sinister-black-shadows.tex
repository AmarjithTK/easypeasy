Sinister Black Shadows

PMOers find it very difficult to believe that masturbation to internet porn actually causes those insecure feelings when you are our late at night after a contentious day at home or work. Non-PMOers do not suffer from that feeling, it is the porn that causes it.

Another of the great joys of quitting porn is the freedom from the sinister black shadows at the back of our minds. All PMOers know they are fools to close their minds on the ill-effects of PMO. For most of our lives PMO is automatic, but the black shadows are always lurking in our subconscious minds, just below the surface. Several of the marvellous benefits of quitting are conscious, such as the waste of time and the sheer stupidity of making love to a two-dimentional image.
