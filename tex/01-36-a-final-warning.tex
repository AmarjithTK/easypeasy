A Final Warning

No PMOer, given the chance of going back to the time before they became hooked with the knowledge they have now, would opt to start. Thousands of PMOers who successfully kick the habit for many years and lead perfectly happy lives, only to get trapped once again. I trust this book will help you to find it relatively easy to stop. But be warned, PMOers who find it easy to stop find it easy to start again, \textbf{do not fall for this trap.}

No matter how long you have stopped or confident that you are that you will never become hooked again, make it a rule of life not to PMO for any reason. Resist the allusios and innuendos in the media and remember how they're pushing their image of 'openness' by bringing porn into the mainstream without realising porn, internet porn and PMO are killers of relationships and of the personal sense of well-being for a huge number of men and some women.

Remember, that first peek or visit will do nothing for you. You will have not withdrawal pangs to relieve and it will make you feel awful. What it will do is put the pleasure of dopamine rush into your mind and brain, a little voice at the back of your mind will be telling you that you want other one. Then you've got the choice of being miserable for a while or starting the whole filthy chain again.
