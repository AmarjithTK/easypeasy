Hey mate, Hackauthor² again. Thanks for reading this book, I hope that it's been helpful in your PMO journey. I remember the first time I read the PMO hackbook, it was like a veil had been lifted from my eyes. The amount of freedom I felt was immense and it's been smooth sailing ever since. It really was as easy as promised.

I'd like to thank my family for putting up with the sound of my keyboard tapping during our holiday, real troopers. New Zealand was very beautiful but the thought of helping coomers was even better. As I was writing this part of in the Melbourne QANTAS lounge my dad is sitting next to me and told me that he wants to "pour glue in all of the keys" and it's for that reason that I can't recommend the Logitech K480 bluetooth keyboard.

If this hackbook helped you, you can do a couple of things to help out:
  \begin{description}
  \item [Recommend EASYPEASY.] Friends don't let friends suffer using the Willpower Method. If you see a guide or someone online referencing Willpower as the best way to quit, link the book and ask why they aren't using EASYPEASY.

  \item [Improve the book.] EASYPEASY is open source and written in LaTeX. If you see an improvement, head to https://gitlab.com/snug/easypeasy and submit your suggestions. You can also join the community at r/easypeasypmo.

  \item [Donate to Alexander Rhodes's legal fund.] The porn industry and it's allies are attempting to destroy NoFap through slander of it's founder. You already know how much money you're saving by quitting, help out our fellow king! https://nofap.com/defend-alex/

They've just ceased boarding for the flight part way through it and some people have gotten quite irate, there's already been a ninety minute delay from engineering and now the pilot wants new tyres. My family has boarded the flight already, but I missed the lift because I was packing away my tablet, so I've headed back to the lounge and have continued writing. PMOing certainly won't help the stress and now that the little monster's fix has been delayed, I wonder how many people will 'reward' themselves tonight.

While I've still got you, did you know the best way to prevent jetlag is to fast and drink minimal water sixteen hours before you need to wake up? I've done it a couple of times and it's been really useful. It's not just jetlag of course, if you've knocked your circadian rhythm out of wack for any reason, like staying up late PMOing, it might help.

Anyway, I'm gonna put my tablet on charge so I can do continue editing on the plane, if it goes down to mechanical error I'l make sure I push the changes to git.

Cheers,\\
Hackauthor²
