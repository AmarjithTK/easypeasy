Should I tell my SO?

Should I tell my wife, girlfriend or partner about my PMO habit? The intention here is that it would help you in quitting. I am of the solid opinion this isn't needed. It would only reinforce your weakness against PMO.

If you slip, you'll feel miserable and guilty if you're following the Willpower Method. Adding the feeling of deceiving your loved one and you'll definitely be pushed through the vicious cycle of slip-lapse-relapse.

If you're caught once, just say you feel good that you got caught, are out of the prison and don't want to talk about it. If your SO breaks up with you (even for some other reason), you will feel guilty for having screwed up you sex life with PMO, or feeling you 'sacrificed' so much if you were successful in quitting, just adding to the heart-ache.

You will look incredibly weak and they will treat you so - only subconsciously of course. But you can smell it, why add the stress?

If nobody knows about it, let it get buried. Nobody needs to know.
