# The End of the Book

Hey mate, Hackauthor² again. Firstly, thank you so incredibly much for reading this book. Freedom is incredible isn't it! The original Hackauthor's book changed my life, and it's been smooth sailing ever since. Would just like to reiterate how much of a top bloke Allen Carr is, who has helped countless others escape the addiction trap.

message for you, thanks for finishing the book :o)

**hypercommunication** to try and beam point into your brain:

free from porn now what? ||| computer bad lmao, go outside. chat with irl friends instead of online strangers (preferrably in person if possible). << discord, reddit, video games, etc makes you more lonely due to social skill killing feedback loop + dopamine desensitisation >> // find better things to care about than porn, change world around you instead of complaining -- you can accomplish a lot, especially with friends! when has top down revolution ever worked -- change starts with you!! campaign locally about issues you care about ||| other traps: nicotine, alcohol (yes, very deep brainwashing. ZERO benefits), caffeine, social media and tech. stop being fortnite playing tiktok consuming zoomer peaking doubledoors with AWP, actually do something. spend time with people you love. you need purpose, drive and dedication. meditate, weightlift, be emotionally vulnerable in relationships, and stop consuming so much xx


EasyPeasy is *far* from perfect and is slowly being rewritten. Ideally, it should be a clear and concise method for freeing yourself once and for all. I'll be combining lessons from CBT, other addiction books and community resources to make a clear and concise guide written in simple language. Ideally, you should be able to give the book to someone who knows absolutely nothing about porn's harmful effects and it was educate and cure them in the one go. Am busy with other projects for the next little bit, (like https://preferences.org.au and a book about computer addiction) but rest assured, it'll get done. No timeline yet xx (prolly early 2022).

## How can I help out EasyPeasy?

Improve the book.

:   EasyPeasy is open source and written in R Markdown. If you notice an improvement, it's very easy to change and you can find a [video guide on how to do so here] NOT DONE YET!!

Translate it!

:   It is impossible to express my gratitude that people are willing to translate this book and help free others. Here's a [comprehensive video guide on setting up RStudio and publishing a translation.] NOT DONE YET!!


Donate to the school letter writing campaign

:   I'm sending physical letters to as many schools as possible and begging them to educate against pornography. If we don't write the future, it will be written by the porn industry.

Here's a video explaining what's happening and [here's the letter that will be sent to as many schools as possible](https://easypeasymethod.org/resources/principal.pdf).

## Moving forward

It's true that you mustn't change your life ***purely*** because you've stopped. But freedom from any addiction will allow you to build the life you didn't know you wanted.

Am actively writing a book about breaking and moving past computer addiction through self-cultivation. It's my own writing, and will work very differently to EasyPeasy. Whilst that's being written, here are some resources that helped me once I'd escaped from porn.

### Additional trap escaping

Please be mindful that the following things are addictive, if you found EasyPeasy useful, please support the authors of these books too!

Nicotine

:   EasyWay's original topic was smoking, and later, vaping. Nicotine is one of of the most addictive chemicals known the man. If you use nicotine, the same method applies, but if you can afford it, please consider supporting EasyWay by buying their books. They use the money to help addicts!

Alcohol

:   Everyone I know, including myself, would've regarded me as a casual drinker. I never had any form of problem with alcohol, but decided in late 2020 to quit it, just for a year, saying to my friends: *"There's plenty of time in the future to drink, so why not get the relationship squared away from the beginning?*". After discussing EasyPeasy with one of my university mentees, he recommended *Kick the Drink... Easily* by Jason Vale (who worked with Allen Carr), which helped him a lot (as he experienced alcoholism). I decided to give it a read to help a friend in the same boat.
:   Like EasyPeasy, *Kick the Drink... Easily* places no pressure on you, and I walked in fully expecting not to quit -- it'd just give me some considerations. After reading, I can safely say that I'll *never* drink ever again and am proud to be a non-drinker. To summarise (and in no way do the book justice) alcohol has a 10 day withdrawal, which is reinforced because most people drink every weekend. Just like how there's no such thing as a porn addict -- just varying degrees of addiction -- so to, alcoholics. Admitting you're not in control generates more fear, alongside publicly labelling you as an 'alcoholic', which encourages you to overlook it.
:   After quitting (escaping) I have found social occasions infinitely more pleasant. We're conditioned to believe that feeling drunk is pleasant, but once you start removing the brainwashing, you quickly find it's anything but. It's a poisonous depressant, leaving you physically and mentally worse off. You're not really yourself, you're stupified, with your inhibitions lowered. It doesn't relieve stress, relax you, make you more social or give you courage. By escaping, it means you'll never have to wake up with a hangover, or seeing your bank account drained, or be left wondering what you said to someone.
:   Alcohol has fooled people for generations and it's time to change the narrative. Consider how many lives have been ruined because of alcohol? Cowards punches, glassing, drink driving, relationship problems and infinitely more. Please, if you take anything from this section, it's to read this book. You can find a [long winded, rambly video about my unremarkable story of qutting alcohol here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk8AF8wW0Sc).

Caffeine

:   Same trap as porn. It's a stimulant, so you get a boost for about a week, but after that it's fully negated by withdrawal. You'll feel better, I promise xx.

Social media (especially outage) and technology

:   Social media is designed to resemble a slot machine. Constant bombardment of information reduces your ability to concentrate, handle stress and your mood. More insidiously, it places your self worth in arbitrary value systems. But more importantly, what emotion are you feeling when you’re reading this paragraph? Is it fear?
:   Like every social media user, you’ve been lured into the most sinister, subtle trap that man and nature have combined to devise (the addiction trap). Reflect, did you ever make the conscious ‘positive’ decision that you needed social media, you needed it permanently in your life, feeling insecure, even panic stricken without it?
:   Yeah, humans aren't built for endless novelty. It's chemically addictive, and there are infinitely better things to do with your time. Always keep in mind what can be accomplished through focusing your attention, campaign local issues you care about, such as sustainability, sex education and others. Never complain, be proactive and ask yourself how you'll influence the world around you. Remember, when has top down revolution ever worked? -- change starts with you.
:   Read: *Smart Phone, Dumb Phone* by John Dicey (EasyWay), *Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Right Now* and [*Exiting Modernity*](https://meta-nomad.net/exiting-modernity) by Meta-Nomad.

### Positve change

**Relationships**

Freedom from pornography will likely open questions on relationships. If you're having dating and relationship difficulties - and even if you aren't - **huge recommend** on *Models* by Mark Manson which discusses vulnerability in relationships. I am equally happy to not fall into the pick-up-artist or incel traps either, it's really not healthy, don't @ me.

**Short Sightedness**

If you have myopia (can't see long) it's completely curable. No laser surgery, eye excercises or magic eye vitamins, just retraining the muscle in your eye using this thing called active focus (basically eye shuttersnap). Myopia comes from too much close up, putting glasses on makes eye muscle weaker, more glasses, cycle repeats. Optometry is unironically (mostly) a scam, and they know this is happening (leaked sales documents, plus many academics discussing). Watch [this video] and consider buying an [endmyopia](https://endmyopia.org) course. My mate [Lance Kozma](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLvkYd7iYVcsp1Ax6Zm1xIg) [top bloke, check him out] recommends [Myopia is Mental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_rfeALgMCU) instead, and says that endmyopia utilises your tendancy for scrolling and redirects it into eye information instead. Might be useful if you have trouble understanding active focus. I have no skin in the game as my eyes are okay.

**Meditation**

Meditation has been shilled previously, but please do give it a try. It's not a religious thing in any way, and it's important to separate meditation -- the practice of noticing thought -- from any preconceived Buddhist notions.
Don't get any kickbacks from this, but personally recommend the *Waking Up* app and course, and you get get a free month of it at the below link. Sam Harris is such a great bloke that if you can't afford it you can request a free year, no questions asked.
<https://share.wakingup.com/a13290>

**Sleep**

*Why we Sleep** is a great book about, you guessed it, sleep. Highly recommend. On a different note, did you know the best way of preventing jetlag is fasting and drinking minimal water sixteen hours before waking up? It's not just for jetlag, if you’ve knocked your circadian rhythm out of wack for any reason, like staying up late looking at porn, it might help.

**Exercise**

Exercise has many benefits for your physical and mental health. My go to book on the subject is *The Leangains Method* by Martin Berkhan. For anyone of any age, weightlifting is pretty much the way to go for keeping yourself healthy and well. Even if you don't have access to gym equipment, you can still make great progress with a bodyweight routine (the reddit one is actually pretty good).

**Anti-consumption**

My favourite piece of text at current is [Exiting Modernity](https://www.meta-nomad.net/exiting-modernity/) by Meta Nomad. It critiques many of the assumptions we make within modern life, and provides a way to unceremoneously exit. It's only 30 pages, but be warned -- it's honestly quite a confronting document, but it's an enlightening experience if you let it be one.

> *"Too late isn't an age or time; too late is when fatigue leads to submission and you forget yourself completely, a potential human dissolved into nothingness*"
>
> --- Meta Nomad, [*Exiting Modernity*](https://meta-nomad.net/exiting-modernity)

Ultimately the suggestions above are just that -- suggestions. What would you like to accomplish? You're free from this awful trap and can use this gift however you wish.

## Thank you

Again, thank you for taking a chance and reading this book. I hope it helps, and it really does mean a lot. Right now, the neurons inside your brain are linking in a unique way, and it's important to keep feeding that. Reread the book as often as you need to; many people forget that removing the brainwashing is -- at least initially -- an active process, and relapse when they forget lessons. Take a moment to make a solemn vow that you'll never watch pornography again, for any reason. There's no guarrentee that the book will work twice, though admittably it has for many people. It's much easier to keep yourself within this mindset than break it and work to get back into it.

If you do relapse, here's the [escape route] I posted on Discord a while back:

Follow these steps in order.
0. Read https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/04/the_abusive_boyfriend.html
1. Read these two reddit posts by u/Different_Guide_5205
	- [Why you're relapsing](https://old.reddit.com/r/pmohackbook/comments/mynwjl/why_youre_relapsing/)
	- [Countering Fear](https://old.reddit.com/r/pmohackbook/comments/n5027n/countering_fear/gxe2a8a/)
2. Read [Freedom Forever](https://sites.google.com/view/freeforever/home) also written by u/Different_Guide_5205
3. *Optional*: Watch episode 5 of *"Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On"* (available on Netflix) entitled Take Me Private (optional at your discretion to see a glimpse of hell as there's some nudity).

Most important point: you are intellectualing using an irrational argument due to fear.

[end escape route]

The pornographic hydra has grown beyond control. While societal response has been slow, you must be optimistic, as every person escaping accelerates the snowball.

Finally, here are the links from the start of the book in case you'd like to share your experiences.

You can also find me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChMZhvS7eV-WoLDu_mRjEEw), where your support is appreciated :o)

If you're having trouble applying the lessons contained within this book, your best bet is posting on the discord or subreddit, where you will find a community of supportive people who are happy to answer any questions you might have. They'll slowly but surely be retired in favour of [Urbit](https://urbit.org), which is a replacement for all of computing and the internet itself. That sounds insane, but it's actually legit. Please see [this video where I explain why this has to happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMZrrDzKOZo).

If you'd like to contact me, please note that I aim to be intentionally hard to reach. If you have an offer, opportunity or introduction that would make my life more interesting, please send through an email to **interesting [the at symbol] easypeasymethod.org**, or message me on Urbit at ~mislyr-midnyt. For the reasons stated above, I'll only respond to proposals that are a good fit for my schedule and interests.

If you'd like you can also

<span style="font-size:xx-large;">[sign up to receive very occasional emails from me](https://forms.gle/p7cTxowaNpKqgi5Z7)</span>

it would be great to let you know about updates to the hackbook and potential initiatives to free more people from the trap (sending physical letters to schools) and some of my other projects (https://preferences.org.au).

Cheers mate,
